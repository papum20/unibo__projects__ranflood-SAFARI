# SAFARI
The Scalable Air-gapped Framework for Automated Ransomware Investigation (SAFARI) platform

## Disclaimers

Launching the ansible playbooks requires downloading a zipped ransomware (usually protectedby a password), which will be transferred to the target machine, unzipped and executed after disabling network interfaces.  
The script `launch-ansible.sh` also downloads it.  

## Usage

Launch the terraform provisioner (before) and the ansible playbooks (after), on the remote hosts:
```bash
./scripts/launch-all.sh
```
This will destroy previous VMs, create new ones and launch the tests, with ansible, on them.  



*	files ending in `.example` are examples of configuration files and should be replaced with actual values, and without `.example`;
*	files in the format `NAME.generated.EXTENSION` are automatically generated by scripts, e.g. `variables.generated.yml` is generated by `launch-ansible.sh`, starting from a single `variables.sh` file;

### Troubleshooting

When launching ansible alone, if the playbook is stuck on some hosts (e.g. `windows` group), it may be due to the fact that their network interfaces were disabled previously by the playbook: connect from proxmox or recreate them.  

Ranflood 0.7-beta will throw an error for missing `vcruntime140_1.dll` : run the installer from https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

## Files

*	`ansible/` : ansible playbooks executed on the remote machines
	*	`checker/` : checker playbooks
	*	`files/` : files to transfer to the hosts
	*	`playbooks/` : example playbooks for some uses
		*	`tasks/` : lists of tasks used in the (external) playbooks
*	`scripts/` : convenience scripts for interacting with proxmox
*	`terraform/` : terraform scripts to deploy the infrastructure
	*	`checker/` : checker scripts
